## Formula of form name

Each form submitted has a system name consisting of random name and serial number. We can use proper formulas to modify form names so that we can easily find specific forms.

#### How to modify formulas of form names
- Click “Workflow Designer” in “Settings”.
- Select the specific flow according to flow category.
- Enter the form-editing page and then click “Form” instead of “Workflow”.
- Click on “Properties” and you can see “Descriptions”, “Form.Form_script”and “Name Formula”.
- Then we can input different formulas to modify its names.

#### How to write and edit formulas
- Name the form with single field in it, such as {Trip Destination}.
- Name the form with the combination of several form fields, such as “{Trip Destination}+{Departure Date}”.
- Name the form with the combination of a default value and a field, such as “On Business”+ “Trip Destination”.
- Name the form with several system fields, such as “Submit_date”+ “applicant_name” +“insname”.

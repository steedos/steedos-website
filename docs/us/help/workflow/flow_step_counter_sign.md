## Countersignature Node

- Two or more users can approve the requests at the node. They must select “Approve” or “Reject”.
- Even though someone select to reject the request, it will flow to next step according to flow settings. Next step approver will take all countersignature opinions into consideration and select following step.
- Admins can specify a range and then the approver in previous step can select several users（no more than two users in Standard version） to countersign the request in next step.

Please refer to “[Approver settings](flow_step_user.md)” for more details.

#### Notice:
Two countersignature nodes cannot be directly connected. Admins can add a node to summarize opinions between the two nodes. And then select approvers for the second countersignature node.

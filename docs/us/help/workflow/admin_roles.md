title: Flow role and position settings
---

Here comes to flow role and position settings, which will attribute to the flow design. For example, admins can create a role called organization manager, and then select several users to play the role. And they will automatically be the approver when initiators are in their organizations. As a result, it’s important to select a corresponding organization for a role.

Detailed steps are listed below. 

#### Create a new role
- Click on “Flow Roles”, and then click the “New” button in pop-up interface.
- Enter the role name, such as “Chief Finance Officer”.

#### Edit or delete the position
- Click “Flow Positions”, and then click on Pen-shaped button to modify the position information or click on “×” to remove the position.

#### Why we choose a position
- **Reduce errors and increase efficiency.** For example, admins can create a role called “Manager” and then assign some users to play the role. If there are requests that need to be approved by the organization manager, the system can automatically send the request to the role (Manager) instead of individual user. Thus, users who initiate the request don’t need to select approvers by themselves. 
- **Cushion the impact of staff turnover.** For example, when the previous manager leaves, admins don’t need to modify the flow. In the other word, admins can assign other users to play the role.

#### Notice
In Steedos Workflow:
- **A user can be assigned to play several roles.** For instance, “A” can be organization manager and secretary-general at the same time.
- **Several users can be assigned to paly the sanme role.** For instance, “Manager” can include manager of sales department and manager of purchasing department.
